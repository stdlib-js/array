## Usage

```javascript
var mskbinary3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/mskbinary3d' );
```

#### mskbinary3d( arrays, shape, fcn )

Applies a binary callback to elements in two three-dimensional nested input arrays according to elements in a three-dimensional nested mask array and assigns results to elements in a three-dimensional nested output array.

```javascript
var add = require( '@stdlib/math/base/ops/add' );
var zeros3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros3d' );

var x = [
    [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ] ],
    [ [ 5.0, 6.0 ], [ 7.0, 8.0 ] ]
];
var z = zeros3d( [ 2, 2, 2 ] );

var mask = [
    [ [ 0, 1 ], [ 0, 0 ] ],
    [ [ 1, 0 ], [ 0, 1 ] ]
];

var shape = [ 2, 2, 2 ];

mskbinary3d( [ x, x, mask, z ], shape, add );
// z => [ [ [ 2.0, 0.0 ], [ 6.0, 8.0 ] ], [ [ 0.0, 12.0 ], [ 14.0, 0.0 ] ] ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **arrays**: array-like object containing two input nested arrays, an input nested mask array, and one output nested array.
-   **shape**: array shape.
-   **fcn**: binary function to apply.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The function assumes that the input and output arrays have the same shape.
-   An element in an input array is "masked" if the corresponding element in the mask array is non-zero.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/base/discrete-uniform' ).factory;
var bernoulli = require( '@stdlib/random/base/bernoulli' ).factory;
var filled3dBy = require( '@stdlib/array/base/filled3d-by' );
var zeros3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros3d' );
var add = require( '@stdlib/math/base/ops/add' );
var mskbinary3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/mskbinary3d' );

var shape = [ 3, 3, 3 ];

var x = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( x );

var y = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( y );

var mask = filled3dBy( shape, bernoulli( 0.5 ) );
console.log( mask );

var z = zeros3d( shape );
console.log( z );

mskbinary3d( [ x, y, mask, z ], shape, add );
console.log( z );
```
