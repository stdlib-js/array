## Usage

```javascript
var ternary3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/ternary3d' );
```

#### ternary3d( arrays, shape, fcn )

Applies a ternary callback to elements in three three-dimensional nested input arrays and assigns results to elements in a three-dimensional nested output array.

```javascript
var add = require( '@stdlib/math/base/ops/add3' );
var zeros3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros3d' );

var x = [ [ [ 1.0, 2.0 ], [ 3.0, 4.0 ] ] ];
var out = zeros3d( [ 1, 2, 2 ] );

var shape = [ 1, 2, 2 ];

ternary3d( [ x, x, x, out ], shape, add );
// out => [ [ [ 3.0, 6.0 ], [ 9.0, 12.0 ] ] ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **arrays**: array-like object containing three input nested arrays and one output nested array.
-   **shape**: array shape.
-   **fcn**: ternary function to apply.

## Notes

-   The function assumes that the input and output arrays have the same shape.

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/base/discrete-uniform' ).factory;
var filled3dBy = require( '@stdlib/array/base/filled3d-by' );
var add = require( '@stdlib/math/base/ops/add3' );
var zeros3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/zeros3d' );
var ternary3d = require( '@stdlib/array/base/ternary3d' );

var shape = [ 3, 3, 3 ];

var x = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( x );

var y = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( y );

var z = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( z );

var out = zeros3d( shape );
console.log( out );

ternary3d( [ x, y, z, out ], shape, add );
console.log( out );
```
