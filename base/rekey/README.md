# rekey

> Copy and rename specified keys for every element in a provided array.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var rekey = require( '@stdlib/array/base/rekey' );
```

#### rekey( arr, mapping )

Copies and renames specified keys for every element in a provided array.

```javascript
var x = [
    {
        'x': 1,
        'y': 2
    },
    {
        'x': 3,
        'y': 4
    }
];
var mapping = {
    'x': 'a',
    'y': 'b'
};

var out = rekey( x, mapping );
// returns [ { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }, { 'a': 3, 'b': 4 } ]
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **arr**: input array.
-   **mapping**: object mapping existing keys to new key names.

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

-   The function **only** copies and renames those keys which are present in a provided mapping object. Any keys which are **not** present in the provided mapping object, but are present in the original objects, are **omitted** during object creation.
-   The function assumes that each object has the keys specified in a provided mapping object.
-   The function performs **shallow** copies of key values.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/base/discrete-uniform' );
var filledBy = require( '@stdlib/array/base/filled-by' );
var rekey = require( '@stdlib/array/base/rekey' );

function clbk( idx ) {
    return {
        'x': idx,
        'y': discreteUniform( 0, 10 )
    };
}

var x = filledBy( 10, clbk );
var mapping = {
    'x': 'a',
    'y': 'b'
};

var out = rekey( x, mapping );
// returns [...]
