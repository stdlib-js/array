{{alias}}( arr, mapping )
    Copies and renames specified keys for every element in a provided array.

    The function only copies and renames those keys which are present in a
    provided mapping object. Any keys which are not present in the provided
    mapping object, but are present in the original objects, are omitted during
    object creation.

    The function assumes that each object has the keys specified in a provided
    mapping object.

    The function performs shallow copies of key values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ArrayLikeObject<Object>
        Input array.

    mapping: Object
        Object mapping existing keys to new key names.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<Object>
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = [ { 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }, { 'x': 3, 'y': 4 } ];
    > var m = { 'x': 'a', 'y': 'b' };
    > var out = {{alias}}( x, m )
    [ { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }, { 'a': 3, 'b': 4 } ]
