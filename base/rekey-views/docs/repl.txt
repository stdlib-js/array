{{alias}}( arr, mapping )
    Returns an array containing views with renamed keys for every element in a
    provided array.

    The function returns views having only those keys which are present in a
    provided mapping object. Any keys which are not present in the provided
    mapping object, but are present in the original objects, are omitted during
    view creation.

    The function assumes that each object has the keys specified in a provided
    mapping object.

    Each view in the returned array shares the same memory as the corresponding
    elements in the input arrays. Accordingly, mutation of either an array
    element or a view will mutate the other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ArrayLikeObject<Object>
        Input array.

    mapping: Object
        Object mapping existing keys to new key names.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<Object>
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = [ { 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }, { 'x': 3, 'y': 4 } ];
    > var m = { 'x': 'a', 'y': 'b' };
    > var out = {{alias}}( x, m );
    > var v = out[ 0 ].toJSON()
    { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
    > v = out[ 1 ].toJSON()
    { 'a': 3, 'b': 4 }
