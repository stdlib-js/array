{{alias}}( x, searchElement, fromIndex )
    Returns the index of the first element which equals a provided search
    element.

    If provided an array-like object having an `indexOf` method, the function
    defers execution to that method and assumes that the method has the
    following signature:

        x.indexOf( searchElement, fromIndex )

    If provided an array-like object without an `indexOf` method, the function
    performs a linear scan and returns immediately upon finding a match.

    If unable to find an element which equals a provided search element, the
    function returns -1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ArrayLikeObject
        Input array.

    searchElement: any
        Search element.

    fromIndex: integer
        Starting index (inclusive). If less than zero, the starting index is
        resolved relative to the last array element, with the last array element
        corresponding to `fromIndex = -1`.

    Returns
    -------
    out: integer
        Index or -1.

    Examples
    --------
    > var out = {{alias}}( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], 3, 0 )
    2
