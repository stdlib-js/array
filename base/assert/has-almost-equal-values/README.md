## Usage

```javascript
var hasAlmostEqualValues = require( '@stdlib/array/base/assert/has-almost-equal-values' );
```

#### hasAlmostEqualValues( x, y, maxULP )

Tests if two arrays have respective elements which are approximately equal within a specified number of ULPs (units in the last place).

```javascript
var x = [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ];
var y = [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ];

var bool = hasAlmostEqualValues( x, y, 1 );
// returns true
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If provided arrays of unequal length, the function returns `false`.
-   The function does **not** skip `undefined` elements and is thus not optimized for sparse arrays.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var uniform = require( '@stdlib/random/array/uniform' );
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );
var hasAlmostEqualValues = require( '@stdlib/array/base/assert/has-almost-equal-values' );

var buf = uniform( 10, 0, 10 );
// returns <Float64Array>

var x = new Complex128Array( buf );
// returns <Complex128Array>

var y = new Complex128Array( buf );
// returns <Complex128Array>

var out = hasAlmostEqualValues( x, y, 1 );
// returns true
```
